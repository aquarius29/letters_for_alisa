# letters for Alisa

This project is created to generate business-card-sized rectangles with letters of the alphabet in the rectangle. 
The goal is to cut out the rectangles, laminate them and play with the baby. 

TBD: 
1. make it work with images, and other stuff, letters worked great though. 
 1.a how-to: give a folder with images to the script and it should resize/crop images to fit the predefined card side and create printable A4 pages with the images inside the card boxes (for printing, cutting and laminating).
